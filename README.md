# Basic-Sockets

This code is *not ready for the open Internet*.  It accepts all connections and an unlimited number of them to boot, and allows them to transfer anything/eveything with unlimited size.  Probably not great for the open Internet.

This is really basic, trying to get a pretty minimal code for simplest functionality.
